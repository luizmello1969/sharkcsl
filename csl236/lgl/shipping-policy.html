			<h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
			<h3>Processing Time</h3>
			<p>Orders typically take 1-2 business days to process before being shipped. Please be aware that processing times may be longer during holidays. If any incorrect or incomplete payment or address information is provided, it may result in an additional 3-5 business days delay.</p>
			<p>Note: All shipping addresses are verified through the US postal service. To ensure accuracy, please verify your address at USPS.com (this does not apply to international orders).</p>
			<p>We ship Monday to Friday, excluding weekends and US public holidays.</p>
			<p><b>Prozenith</b> is not responsible for any delays in delivery as it requires 1-2 business days for processing. We cannot be held liable for shipping guarantees made by USPS.</p>
			<h3>Domestic Delivery Time – Standard Shipping</h3>
			<p>Delivery times will vary depending on the shipping method chosen and do not include weekends or holidays. All times are estimates, and <b>Prozenith</b> is not accountable for delays caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as weather conditions, labor strikes, or transportation issues.</p>
			<h3>Refused, Lost, Stolen, or Delayed Packages</h3>
			<p>If a package is refused upon delivery, the shipping fee will be deducted from your refund. Refunds for refused packages will only be processed once the product is received and inspected by our team.</p>
			<p><b>Prozenith</b> primarily uses United Parcel Service (UPS) for shipping. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee replacements for lost or stolen packages shipped via UPS. If you experience any delays or issues with your delivery, please contact us at <a href="https://getprozenith.com">getprozenith.com</a>. <b>Prozenith</b> is not liable for any lost, stolen, or delayed packages.</p>
			<p>Note: International shipping to some countries may take 4-6 weeks, or up to 8-12 weeks in rare cases. <b>Prozenith</b> is not responsible for delays caused by customs clearance in the destination country. Additional shipping fees may apply for certain countries due to their geographical location.</p>
			<h3>Order Cancellation</h3>
			<p>Due to high order volume, once placed, your order goes directly into our fulfillment process. If you need to cancel, please contact us within 24 hours of purchase. Orders cannot be canceled if they have already been processed or shipped. If the order has shipped, you may refuse the package or return it to us with a valid tracking number, and notify us for a refund upon receipt.</p>
			<h3>Wrong Address Disclaimer</h3>
			<p>It is the buyer's responsibility to ensure that the shipping address is entered correctly. <b>Prozenith</b> is not responsible for packages sent to an incorrect address provided by the buyer. If your order has been processed or shipped, we cannot change the address. If the package is returned to us, you may choose between a reshipment or a refund.</p>
			<h3>Delivery of Items</h3>
			<p>If the tracking information indicates that a package has been delivered but you did not receive it, <b>Prozenith</b> does not offer refunds. In such cases, please contact USPS for further assistance.</p>
			<h3>Returns</h3>
			<p>To receive a full refund, you must return all bottles (full, empty, or partially full, including any "bonus" or "free" bottles) within 60 days of your original purchase date. Include a written or printed note with the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your Order ID (found on your receipt)</li>
				<li>Your Full Name and Address where the order was delivered</li>
				<li>Your Email Address and Phone Number</li>
				<li>Your original packaging slip (if available)</li>				
			</ul>
			<p>Note: Failure to return all bottles may result in a partial refund.</p>
			<p>For your return to be processed, it must arrive at our facility within 60 days of the original purchase date. You are responsible for return shipping costs. Once received and verified, your refund will be credited back to your account and may take 3-5 business days to appear, depending on your bank's processing time.</p>
			<p>Send all returns to:</p>
			<p><b>Prozenith</b><br>19655 E 35th Dr #100, Aurora, CO 80011</p>
			<p>Please provide a tracking number for your return to avoid delays in processing.</p>
